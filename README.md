## MZS NodeStack

This is my first attempt at a node package, to be deployed on NPM.

```js
const nodeStack = require('mzs-nodestack')
```

Format:

```js
const server = express()
nodeStack(server)
```

### Goal

[ ] create a useful node package
[ ] include standard node packages, so only invoke this one package is needed
[ ] MERN standard packages
[ ] make it easy to improve and update
